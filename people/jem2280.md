I am currently a third-year clinical fellow in Hematology and Medical Oncology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Biomedical Informatics in DBMI. My research involves the evaluation of breast imaging-based biomarkers of response to breast cancer therapies, with a focus on novel imaging technologies and deep learning algorithms. For my fellowship with DBMI, I am working with Dr. Rita Kukafka to develop methods of assessing breast cancer risk with data generated from the electronic health record (EHR), which would allow for potentially more nuanced evaluations of risk but also could better inform decisions regarding risk-modifying practices, such as chemoprevention.
