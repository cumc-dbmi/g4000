## Current Projects and Interests
# OHDSI
I'm a collaborator in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (or OHDSI, pronounced "Odyssey") program, that is a multi-stakeholder, interdisciplinary collaborative to bring out the value of health data through large-scale analytics. OHDSI has established an international network of researchers and observational health databases with a central coordinating center housed at Columbia University.
My particular field of interest is medical ontologies standardization.Standardized ontologies are the backbone of any modern medical data model. They provide a model with a common language that is used in database maintenance and integration both with users and with back-end applications. Ontologies support clinical decision support, provide a framework for a doctor â€“ electronic healthcare record interaction and facilitate clinical care and management and represent knowledge representation in a reliable and structured fashion. I, as a part of the vocabulary team, adress the need for the development of policies and common approaches that will facilitate these tasks.
