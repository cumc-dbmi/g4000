Hello, my name is Kae Nurge and I am a first-year MA student in the 
Biomedical Informatics department. I come from a molecular biology 
background and am interested in the translational/bioinformatics track. 
Most of my research experience comes from wet lab work. I've studied 
protein characterization in a biochemistry lab and protein interactions in 
a molecular biology lab. Because of this, I would love to continue 
researching in the molecular sphere, but this time from a computational 
perspective.
