I am a research associate in a proteomics group at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, working primarily on epitope mapping by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Our group also performs total or targeted proteomic analysis for target discovery, antibody or target characterization, antibody-drug conjugate analysis, and occasionally, reagent/cell line/mouse cohort validation. My interest in bioinformatics began with the difficulties our group has encountered in analyzing, organizing, and storing information from mass spectrum data. I am studying biomedical informatics part-time to learn about the usage of informatics in the -omics and medical fields, and hope to be able to build on current knowledge in these fields to build tools for facilitating data analysis, interpretation, and presentation of complex proteomics data.
