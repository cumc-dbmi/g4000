I'm interested in researching causal genes and mechanisms of diseases. My background is in genetics and I'm highly interested in working with genetic data. Currently one of the projects I'm working on is mapping the KEGG medicus database containing disease genotypes to the HPO database of disease phenotypes. It's been incredibly challenging in the sense that a lot of the data is not in the same format, has varying references, and isn't necessarily well annotated.
