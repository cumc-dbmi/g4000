### About Me

Hello! I'm Elizabeth and I am a first-year MA student at Columbia DBMI interested in the Translational/Bioinformatics track. After graduating from Colgate University, where I studied Molecular Biology and Economics, I have been working on the preclinical evaluation of novel ALS therapeutics at CUIMC.
