Diagnoses rely on the phenotype definition in observational research, while the data are stored in different vocabularies, including ICD9-CM, ICD10-CM, SNOMED CT, and MedDRA, at different areas and for various purposes. The observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) produced the mappings from 80 vocabularies to the standard vocabularies. For example, SNOMED CT is the standard vocabulary for diagnoses of OHDSI. The source and mapped data are stored in the data model named Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). One common concern is the loss of information during the converting process. This study looks at the question whether the vocabulary mapping would cause the difference in patient cohorts. We will focus on the existing phenotype algorithms from eMERGE PheKB, evaluate its cohorts generated by OHDSI with respect to the cohorts generated by gold standard.
